# BPY-Binaries

This is a dummy project containing mainly automation code for building Blender as Python
module (bpy) and hosting binaries. Blender itself is pretty selective in what it supports,
therefore Blender have to be rebuild for each Python version. It means that separate binary
is needed for Blender 3.5.1 to work with Python 3.10 and separate for Python 3.11.

Blender project itself [can be found here](https://www.blender.org).
